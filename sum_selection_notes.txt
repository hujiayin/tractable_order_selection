Code structure
- bottom_up_count should probably be moved to a different utils class because it is used in both SUM and LEX



Simplifying assumptions
- order always ascending (for descending, we can multiply every attribute with negative weight)
- for now, only full queries with 2 atoms (to generalize, need to check condition and build join tree with SUM variables on adjacent nodes)
- connection is not empty
- zero indexing. Is this the same for the rest of the code?
